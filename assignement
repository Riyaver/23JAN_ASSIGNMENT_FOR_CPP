1) Can you provide an example of a custom exception class in C++?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class custom : public exception 
{
    public:
		void get() 
		{
        	cout<<"Customised Exception"<<endl;
    	}
};
int main() 
{
    try 
	{
        throw custom();
    } 
	catch (custom c) 
	{
        c.get();
    }
}

2) What happens if an exception is not caught in a C++ program?
If an exception is thrown and not caught then depending on compiler an error message is displayed saying the catch block is not declared and in some compiler
the program is terminated giving erro message as "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char'", since there is no catch block to catch the character.

3) What is the difference between a try-catch block and a try-throw-catch block?
In a try-catch block, the expection handling program contains only two blocks eing try and catch. Whenever there occurs an erro in try block the ctach block will 
automatically get implmented without calling it. This structure of exception handling is usually visible in java.

In try-throw-catch blockthe program contains three parts being try{} where the criteria for exception is declared, next is throw from where the program execution shifts 
catch block where what action to perform in case of corresponding error according throw is specified. This type of structure in mostly used in C, C++ and java and is 
mostly accepted by all the compliers.

5) OUTPUT OF THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM.
#include <iostream>  
#include <exception>  
using namespace std;  
class MyException : public exception{  
    public:  
        const char * what() const throw()  
        {  
            return "Attempted to divide by zero!\n";  
        }  
};  
int main()  
{  
    try  
    {  
        int x, y;  
        cout << "Enter the two numbers : \n";  
        cin >> x >> y;  
        if (y == 0)  
        {  
            MyException z;  
            throw z;  
        }  
        else  
        {  
            cout << "x / y = " << x/y << endl;  
        }  
    }  
    catch(exception& e)  
    {  
        cout << e.what();  
    }  
}  
o/p:-
no.= 7,0
Attempted to divide by zero!
